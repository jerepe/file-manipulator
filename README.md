# First Script written from scratch 

### What does it do ?
> You want to build a new project, you have your files stored in a folder named folder1.  
> You want to copy all files from folder1 to folder 2, except one thing: some content in the file named secretfile.txt need to be hidden before sharing folder2. The program will hide this content.  

### How does it looks ?
> ![result](video.mp4)

### How do i use it ?
> Program will ask for your name, then ask if you want to keep going or not. If you chose to do so, it'll go on with the previously explained task.

### How was it done ?
> Using Emacs, the CLI, and Bash.

### Why ?
> Needed to review some bash scripting concepts, so took on the quizz then the last project offered by CodeCademy to do so. Followed their plan, then changedsome of the content partially to train myself on some concepts.  
> I then decided it to customize it so anyone could use it and see immediately its effect by adding the creation of two empty folders (folder1 and folder2), a text file secretfile.txt, and easy-to-spot names over the project.
> Was fun ! ;)
