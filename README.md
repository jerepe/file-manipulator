# File Manipulator
## First Custom Script written from scratch!

### What does it do ?
> You want to build a new project, you have your files stored in a folder named folder1.  
> You want to copy all files from folder1 to folder 2, except one thing: some content in the file named secretfile.txt need to be hidden before sharing folder2. The program will take care of moving the files, and hiding the secret file's content.  

### How does it looks ?
> After making this video, i changed the content of the program to add folder1 and folder2 creation, and modified a bit the display. But it does a very similar job ! Just figured it was cool to add my first video to the project ;)

### How do i use it ?
> Program will ask for your name, then ask if you want to keep going or not. If you chose to do so, it'll go on with the previously explained task.

### How was it done ?
> Using Bash, Emacs, and the CLI.

### Why ?
> Needed to review some bash scripting concepts, so took on the quizz then the last project offered by CodeCademy to do so. 
> I decided to play around to customize to deepend my understanding and for the users to see its effect as fast as possible by adding the creation of two empty folders (folder1 and folder2), a text file (secretfile.txt), and easy-to-spot names over the project.
